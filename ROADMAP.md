# Spatio Project Roadmap

> Goal: Build a modern geospatial database that provides the best performance and development experience

## üéØ Project Overview

Spatio is a high-performance geospatial database developed in Rust, designed for modern applications. Our goal is to provide the best performance, stronger type safety, and a more modern development experience.

### Core Advantages
- üöÄ **High Performance**: Rust zero-cost abstractions + asynchronous architecture
- üîí **Memory Safety**: Memory safety guaranteed by Rust's type system
- ‚ö° **Concurrency Friendly**: Native async support for high-concurrency processing
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Friendly**: Clear error messages and modern toolchain
- üåê **Cloud Native**: Container-first, microservice-friendly
- üåê **Scalable Clusters**: Horizontally scalable clusters
- üåê **Observability**: Clear and easy-to-use observability

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Basic Architecture
- Asynchronous Tokio runtime
- RESP protocol support (Redis compatible)

#### Data Storage
- GeoJSON data storage support
- geo::Geometry type support
- R-tree spatial indexing
- Concurrent-safe storage architecture

#### Basic Commands
- `SET` - Store geospatial objects
- `GET` - Retrieve geospatial objects
- `INTERSECTS` - Intersection queries (‚ú® Core functionality implemented)
- `DELETE` - Delete geospatial objects (includes R-tree deletion optimization)
- `PING` - Connection testing

#### Toolchain
- CLI client (command-line and interactive modes)
- Parameter parsing and validation system
- Robust error handling mechanism
- Performance benchmark suite (verified performance advantage vs Tile38)

## üöß Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Core Spatial Functions (MVP)
> Goal: Implement basic geospatial query functionality  
> Status: Completed  
> Planned completion: Completed

## üèÜ Competitive Advantages

### Advantages over Tile38

| Feature | Tile38 | Spatio | Advantage Description |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------------|
| **Language** | Go | Rust | Better memory safety and performance |
| **Concurrency Model** | Goroutines | Async/Await + RwLock | Lower memory/CPU overhead |
| **Spatial Indexing** | Basic R-tree | **Highly optimized concurrent R-tree** | **4.65x QPS improvement, 5.2x latency reduction** |
| **Type Safety** | Runtime checks | Compile-time guarantees | Fewer runtime errors |
| **Memory Management** | GC | Zero-cost abstractions | **More predictable performance** |

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/your-org/spatio.git
cd spatio

# Install dependencies
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Start service
cargo run --bin spatio-server

# Use client
cargo run --bin spatio-cli -- PING
```

### Code Standards

- Follow official Rust code style
- All public APIs must have documentation
- New features must include tests
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
