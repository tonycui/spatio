# Spatio Project Roadmap

> Goal: Build a modern geospatial database that provides the best performance and development experience

## 🎯 Project Overview

Spatio is a high-performance geospatial database developed in Rust, designed for modern applications. Our goal is to provide the best performance, stronger type safety, and a more modern development experience.

### Core Advantages
- 🚀 **High Performance**: Rust zero-cost abstractions + asynchronous architecture
- 🔒 **Memory Safety**: Memory safety guaranteed by Rust's type system
- ⚡ **Concurrency Friendly**: Native async support for high-concurrency processing
- 🛠️ **Developer Friendly**: Clear error messages and modern toolchain
- 🌐 **Cloud Native**: Container-first, microservice-friendly
- 🌐 **Scalable Clusters**: Horizontally scalable clusters
- 🌐 **Observability**: Clear and easy-to-use observability

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Basic Architecture
- Asynchronous Tokio runtime
- RESP protocol support (Redis compatible)

#### Data Storage
- GeoJSON data storage support
- geo::Geometry type support
- R-tree spatial indexing
- Concurrent-safe storage architecture

#### Basic Commands
- `SET` - Store geospatial objects
- `GET` - Retrieve geospatial objects
- `INTERSECTS` - Intersection queries (✨ Core functionality implemented)
- `DELETE` - Delete geospatial objects (includes R-tree deletion optimization)
- `PING` - Connection testing

#### Toolchain
- CLI client (command-line and interactive modes)
- Parameter parsing and validation system
- Robust error handling mechanism
- Performance benchmark suite (verified performance advantage vs Tile38)

## 🚧 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Core Spatial Functions (MVP)
> Goal: Implement basic geospatial query functionality  
> Status: Completed  
> Planned completion: Completed

### Phase 2: Core Function Enhancement
> Status: In Progress  
> Planned completion: October 2025

**Spatial Query Enhancement**
- [x] `WITHIN` - Containment queries
- [x] `NEARBY` - Nearest neighbor queries (✨ KNN algorithm + command integration completed)
- [ ] Query result sorting and pagination

**Data Management Commands**
- [x] `KEYS` - List all collections
- [x] `DROP` - Delete entire collection
- [x] `INFO` - Database statistics

**Basic Persistence**
- [ ] Data persistence to disk
- [ ] Data recovery on startup
- [ ] Basic WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
- [ ] R-tree persistence optimization (based on existing serialization support)
- [ ] AOF rewrite
- [ ] AOF file lock : to prevent 2 processes write to the same file

### Phase 3: Clustering and Distribution
> Goal: Provide scalable distributed clusters  
> Status: Not started  
> Planned completion: December 2025

- [ ] Enhancement
  - [ ] gracefully shutdown, in both cli and docker
- [ ] Master-slave replication
  - [ ] Asynchronous replication
- [ ] Sharding support
  - [ ] Automatic sharding
  - [ ] Data rebalancing
- [ ] Cluster management
  - [ ] Node discovery
  - [ ] Health monitoring
  - [ ] Load balancing

### Phase 4: Geofencing Management Backend
> Goal: Comprehensive visual geofencing management backend  
> Status: Not started  
> Planned completion: February 2026

- [ ] Web management interface
- [ ] Map visualization tools
- [ ] Data import/export tools
- [ ] Migration tools


### Phase 5: Ecosystem
> Goal: Comprehensive developer ecosystem  
> Status: Not started  
> Planned completion: April 2026

**Client Libraries**
- [ ] Python client
- [ ] JavaScript/Node.js client
- [ ] Go client
- [ ] Java client
- [ ] .NET client
- [ ] PHP client

**Cloud Native**
- [ ] Kubernetes support
- [ ] Service mesh integration
